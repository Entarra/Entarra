### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a silly, self-taught "programmer" that mostly write little greasemonkey scripts to tweak and "hack" websites I frequent.
As such I mainly write in Javascript, but know some CSS and HTML too, even if I'm well behind the current spec on all three.

Won't be a ton to see in here as most of my projects are private little things for me and my guild on Lyrania.co.uk, but we'll see where things go.
